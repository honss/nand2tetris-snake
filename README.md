# nand2tetris-snake
 Making snake in the nand2tetris assembly language

This project was done at school over the course of a few months, and I didn't have access to git. The several files are a terrible form of version control. v4 is the final version.
The code runs on the nand2tetris CPUsimulator, the culmination of a course that teaches the basics of computer architecture and logic circuits.
